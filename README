Known issues
------------

- Plain double quotes are neither rendered verbatim nor processed in any way by
flat2tex. As result they are always typeset as closing curly double quotes,
which is ugly. For the time being there is no way to overcome this than either
manually edit generated flat files, replacing double quotes with `` and '' as
necessary (which is, of course, a solution far from ideal, if a solution at all)
or use `` and '' in the original full file (which is rather unacceptable as it
binds the file to LaTeX, which is against the very rationale behind cvxmltools).
In other words, there is no actual solution for the time being, so stay tuned.

- Multilingual support has not been adequately tested. Make sure your rendering
tool of choice is properly configured for your target languages.

- Full Unicode support has not been adequately tested. Make sure your rendering
tool of choice is properly configured to handle Unicode characters.
